## FINANCE AGENCY WEBSITE :

I have designed a template for a digital agency website in which there is features like;

Pricing

Blog

# TECH STACK :

HTML (for structure), CSS (for styling) and JAVASCRIPT (for functionality). I found it easier to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript, because the project wasnt a complex one and used my knowledge of UI/UX design to use the avaliable figma as a reference.
